# Train Scheduler

In this project I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host train data including: first train time, frequency of train, train name and destination. A user can submit this information on the application and it is saved to Firebase. The application retrieves and manipulates this information with the help of Moment.js. The website provides up-to-date information about the various trains including: their name, destination, frequency, arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.  I have added a delete button on the table rows for each train submitted, allowing the user to delete that train if desired...
